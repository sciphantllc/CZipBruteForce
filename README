          CZipBruteForce - a fast zip password cracker
========================================================================

CZipBruteForce is a fast, multi-threaded zip password brute force tool.

Given a non-AES password-protected zip file, it will attempt to find the
password by using all combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols.  It
has been observed to attempt over 160M passwords/second on a 3.6 Ghz 
machine with 8 logical processors when using the 64-bit release build.

This tool was implemented as a proof of the various implemented 
concepts and is not meant to be a user-friendly tool, which is an 
exercise left to the reader.  A description of these concepts is 
in the included file "Zip Password Cracking.docx".
