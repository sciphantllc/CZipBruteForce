          CZipBruteForce - a fast zip password cracker
========================================================================

CZipBruteForce is a fast, multi-threaded zip password brute force tool.

Given a non-AES password-protected zip file, it will attempt to find the
password by using all combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols.  It
has been observed to attempt over 160M passwords/second on a 3.6 Ghz 
machine with 8 logical processors when using the 64-bit release build.

This tool was implemented as a proof of the various implemented 
concepts and is not meant to be a user-friendly tool (which is an 
exercise left to the reader).  A description of these concepts is 
in the included file "Zip Password Cracking.docx".

To build: 
	1) Download the zlib source code from http://zlib.net/ and put
	it so that the zlib-<version> directory is in the CZipBruteForce
	solution directory so it will look like:
		CZipBruteForce
		 |- zlib-1.2.8
			 |- adler32.c
			 |- ...

	2) Build the assembly libraries found in:
		zlib-1.2.8\contrib\masmx64 and masmx86
	Directions for these are found in the readme.txt files in those 
	directories.  Alternatively, change the CZipBruteForce project to use the
	"ReleaseWithoutAsm" versions of the zlibstat.lib.  The non-assembly 
	version is likely slower, but not by a huge percentage.

	3) Reload the "zlibstat" project in this solution.
